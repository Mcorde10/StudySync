# StudySync
This is the Code and Coding pathway to complete StudySync
Many students struggle to stay on top of homework, tests, projects, and personal study goals. Juggling multiple classes and due dates with just paper planners or memory can be overwhelming. That’s why I want to create StudySync – a simple, Python-based desktop program that helps students manage their academic lives more easily. This program will be designed to run from the command line or, if time permits, through a basic graphical interface using Tkinter. It will focus on practical features that can help students get organized without needing internet access or advanced software.

StudySync is meant for middle school, high school, or college students who need a better way to organize their academic responsibilities. It could also be useful for study groups who want to share a saved schedule, or for tutors who want to set and track weekly goals with their students. The software will include a task manager that allows users to add assignments or study goals along with due dates and subjects. When users open the app, it will check for any upcoming deadlines and provide reminders, such as “⚠️ Science project is due tomorrow!” Tasks can be marked as completed, and the app will track progress by showing how many tasks are finished versus how many remain. The app will use a simple menu system that allows users to add a task, view all tasks, mark a task as done, delete a task, or exit.

The program will use basic Python libraries such as datetime for managing due dates, json for storing and loading tasks, and os for file management. If time allows, we could add a basic graphical user interface using Tkinter to make the app more user-friendly. For inspiration and guidance, I looked at several beginner-friendly projects and tutorials, including a simple task manager in Python from GitHub (git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager-cli.git). This resource shows that it’s possible to build useful productivity apps with beginner-level Python skills, and they provide a foundation to build upon.

This project is ideal for a group of two people. One person can handle the core logic of adding, saving, and updating tasks, while the other focuses on building the interface and helping with testing. StudySync is simple but powerful. It solves a real problem that students face daily—staying organized and keeping up with assignments. It’s also a great way to apply what we’ve learned so far in Python and explore new skills like working with files, dates, and possibly GUIs. Most importantly, this project is something we can realistically build, test, and use ourselves, and it could even be useful to others in our class or school.
